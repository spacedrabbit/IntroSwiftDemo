var smallMeasuringCup: String = "milk"
var smallGlassBowl: String = "sugar"
var mediumGlassBowl: String = "eggs"
var largeGlassBowl: String = "flour"

// 1. Assign the value of smallMeasuringCup to a new variable named smallGlassBowl
//var smallWoodenBowl: String = smallMeasuringCup

// 2. What's in smallMeasuringCup now? Use a print statement to find out
//print(smallMeasuringCup)

// 3. Let's add some water now to the smallMeasuringCup. Check to make sure you have water in it
//smallMeasuringCup = "water"

// 4. Finally, let's assign the value in smallMeasuringCup to largeGlassBowl. Try to guess what is in the smallMeasuringCup and largeGlassBowl after this action before writing anything out. 
//largeGlassBowl = smallMeasuringCup
//print(largeGlassBowl)
//print(smallMeasuringCup)
