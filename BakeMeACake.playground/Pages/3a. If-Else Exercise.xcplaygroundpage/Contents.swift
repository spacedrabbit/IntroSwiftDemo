//: As a reminder, this is what we had from the last page:
var eggsAreInTheirShells = true
if eggsAreInTheirShells == true {
  print("Cracking eggs!")
}
else {
  print("Eggs are ready to go!")
}

//: * callout(Instructions): Ok, as head baker, I'm going to make a few things available to you to do these checks. There are checks I've instructed the computer to understand:
/*:
 1. `checkIfEggsAreCracked()` will say `true` or `false` depending on if the eggs are cracked
 2. `crackEggs()` will crack your eggs
 3. `areTheEggsGradeA()` will say `true` or `false`
 4. `areTheEggsFresh()` will say `true` or `false`
 */

// 1. Similar to the above example, check if the eggs are fresh. If they are, print out something to let us know. 

// 2. Now, let's check if the eggs are Grade A. If they aren't, let's definitely make sure we know.

// 3. Let's now check if the eggs are cracked. If they are, then crack them! Then, check to make sure they are actually cracked. (Bonus: assign the results to a variable and then make your check on the variable)
