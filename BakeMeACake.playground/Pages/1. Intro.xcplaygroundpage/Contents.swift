 ### Introduction
 
 I think of programming as the art of making something from nothing; much in the same way that a baker creates a cake from scratch.
 Both follow a series of precise steps, using a set of specified ingredients, to create something wonderful that others can enjoy.  All through out this intro, we're going to be making a cake using the tools and ingredients provided to us by Swift. And although the result will not be as tasty as a real cake, it will be just as sweet to make.
