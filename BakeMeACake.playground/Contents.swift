// Guidelines:
// 1. 20 minutes total
// 2. Variables, Functions & Control structures
// 3. "Students" are completely new to programming

// Goals
// 1. Strong command of vocabulary
// 2. Student has all their questions answered

// Needs
// 1. Challenging questions for students
// 2. Checks for comprehension

// Avoid
// 1. Lecturing only
// 2. Passive learning, student should be engaged

// My Notes:
// 1. Make code as conversational as possible
// 2. 5 - 7 steps/chunks maximum
// 3. Start with variables, then add in a check with if-else, then wrap it all in a funciton
// 4. Add in periodic questions

 ### The Variable

 I think of programming as the art of making something from nothing; much in the same way that a baker creates a cake from scratch.
 Both follow a series of precise steps, using a set of specified ingredients, to create something wonderful that others can enjoy.
 
 And like a baker's cooking instruments, programmers have names for the tools that they use. The first of which is: **variable**
 A *variable* can be thought of as a bucket that can hold anything you give it. Variables are used to stand-in for the value that you give it to hold.

/*:
 Lets look at a simple example:
 
`var headBaker = "Louis"`
 
 Remember, a variable just holds anything you *assign* to it. In this case we *assign* may name, "Louis", to be held by the `headBaker` `variable`. In Swift, we write `var` as a shorthard for `variable`. 
 
 Now, we can use the variable `headBaker` elsewhere, but the computer will know that we actually mean to use "Louis". What's this look like?
 
 `print(headBaker)` // prints out "Louis" to the screen
*/


/*:
 Lets look at a simple example:
 
    print("Hello, Louis!")
 
 The `print()` command's job is to simply type out exactly what you tell it to. So in this example, we're telling it to print out "Hello, Louis!"
 */


print(" YOUR NAME ") // add your name in between the quotes and see what's printed -->


/*:
 This line that's telling the computer to *print* something out is an example of a **statement**, also known as a **command**. Computer programs are literally just lots of these (sometimes in the 1000's!) **commands** put together.
 
  You'll be using `print` a TON since it's so versitle. So let's squirrel it away for later use.
